                    <h2>A little about me</h2>
                    <p class="text"> I am aspiring to be the best software developer I can be. That aspiration 
                        is what brought me to Galvanize, so I would gain the most important skill
                        I could: learing how to learn. I was born and raised across the street from the Disneyland
                        amusement park in Anaheim, California.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text">
                        I enlisted in the Army at the age of 19 in 2007 as a Military Police Officer. My first assignment
                        was in Heidelberg, Germany where I conducted Honor and Color Guard ceremonies. With a highspeed
                        attitude, I was quickly selected for Protective Services after threatening to shoot a lady in front
                        of former Vice President Dick Chaney. I spent a year serving as 4 star General in command of the Army in
                        Europe.

                    <p class="text">
                        After 2 years in Germany, I was stationed at Fort Carson in Colorado Springs, where I spent 3 years 
                        conducting strictly law enforcement. It was during that time where I discovered that I had no real
                        interest in continuing in that field of work. Admittedly, transitioning out of the Army was significantly
                        more difficult than I had anticipated. It has taken me just over 6 years to figure out what direction
                        I wanted my life to move into and discovered the development industry.
