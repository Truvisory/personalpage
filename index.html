                        <p class="text"> I am aspiring to be the best software developer I can be. That aspiration 
                            is what brought me to Galvanize, so I would gain the most important skill
                            I could: learing how to learn. I was born and raised across the street from the Disneyland
                            amusement park in Anaheim, California.

                            I joined the Army at the age of 19 in 2007 as a Military Police Officer. My first assignment
                            was in Heidelberg, Germany where I conducted Honor and Color Guard ceremonies. With a highspeed
                            attitude, I was quickly selected for Protective Services after threatening to shoot a lady in front
                            of Vice President Dick Chaney. I spent a year serving as 4 star General in command of the Army in
                            Europe.
